            <h3>he Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.[4][5][6] The original model
                became far more popular than anticipated selling outside of its target market for uses such as robotics. Peripherals (including keyboards, mice and cases) are not included with the Raspberry Pi. Some accessories however have been included
                in several official and unofficial bundles.</h3>

            <h1>Is the Raspberry Pi open hardware?</h1>
            <h2>The Raspberry Pi is open hardware, with the exception of the primary chip on the Raspberry Pi, the Broadcomm SoC (System on a Chip), which runs many of the main components of the boardâ€“CPU, graphics, memory, the USB controller, etc. Many of
                the projects made with a Raspberry Pi are open and well-documented as well and are things you can build and modify yourself.</h2>

            <h1>What are the differences in Raspberry Pi models?</h1>
            <h4>The Raspberry Pi Foundation has just recently released a new model, the Raspberry Pi 2, which supersedes some of the previous boards, although the older boards will still be produced as long as there is a demand for them. It is generally backwards
                compatible with previous versions of the board, so any tutorials or projects you see which were built for a previous version of the board should still work. There are a two Raspberry Pi models, the A and the B, named after the aforementioned
                BBC Micro, which was also released in a Model A and a Model B. The A comes with 256MB of RAM and one USB port. It is cheaper and uses less power than the B. The current model B comes with a second USB port, an ethernet port for connection
                to a network, and 512MB of RAM.</h4>
